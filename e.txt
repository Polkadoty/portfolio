1. What is the project's main objective?
   The main objective of the project is to build a comprehensive wiki website that compiles your class notes from middle school, high school, and college, focusing on aerospace engineering, writing, data science, and general technical knowledge. The wiki will be organized using a hierarchical structure, with markdown files as the content format, and will include features like search functionality, internal and external links, and responsive design.

2. Who will be the main users of the project?
   The main users of the project will be you and any other individuals interested in the subjects covered by your class notes, such as students, teachers, or professionals looking for reference material or a deeper understanding of the topics.

3. What technologies will be used in the project?
   The project will utilize a static site generator (e.g., Gatsby or Next.js), a headless CMS (e.g., Strapi or Contentful), and potentially a search library like Lunr.js or Elasticsearch. The frontend will be built using React.js, and the project will follow best practices for code organization, performance, security, and responsiveness. Version control will be managed through Git, and the project will be hosted on GitHub.

4. How will the project be organized?
   The project will be organized using a hierarchical structure, with content divided into categories, subcategories, and individual topics. Markdown files will be used to store content, and version control will be managed through Git. Consistent file naming conventions and directory structures will be followed throughout the project. The codebase will be modular, with a focus on clean and efficient code, and will follow best practices for React.js and the chosen headless CMS.

5. What is the timeline for the project?
   The timeline for the project depends on your availability and the complexity of the wiki.
