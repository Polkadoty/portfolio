## Introduction

This document outlines the code standards for the Comprehensive Wiki Project, including guidelines for variable naming, writing clean and efficient code, and code review practices.

## Variable Naming

a. Use descriptive and meaningful variable names that clearly represent the purpose of the variable.
b. Follow established naming conventions for your programming language (e.g., camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python).
c. Avoid single-letter variable names or abbreviations, except for common conventions (e.g., `i` for loop counters).
d. Use constants for values that do not change throughout the program and use the appropriate naming convention (e.g., UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES in JavaScript).

## Clean and Efficient Code

a. Strive to write the cleanest and most efficient code possible, prioritizing readability and maintainability.
b. Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable units that perform a single task.
c. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance and resource usage.
d. Keep functions and classes focused on a single responsibility, following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
e. Comment your code to provide context and improve understanding for other developers. Use concise and clear language.
f. Remove unnecessary code and comments, such as commented-out code or redundant statements.

## Code Review and Self-check

a. Always review your own code before submitting it for review or merging it into the main branch.
b. Look for potential bugs, performance issues, and areas where the code could be improved or refactored.
c. Be open to feedback from other team members during code reviews and be prepared to make adjustments based on their suggestions.
d. Participate in code reviews for other team members' work, providing constructive feedback and suggestions.
e. Continuously learn and apply best practices and new techniques to improve your code quality.
