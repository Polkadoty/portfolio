## Introduction

This wiki is focused on providing guidance for building a comprehensive wiki website with an emphasis on content organization, backend, search functionality, hyperlinks and connections, security and performance, and responsiveness.

## Content Organization and Storage

a. Use a hierarchical structure to organize content by categories, subcategories, and individual topics.
b. Store the content in a lightweight format, such as Markdown or plain text files, for easy editing and version control.
c. Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate on content updates.

## Backend

a. Use a static site generator (e.g., Gatsby, Next.js) to build the wiki pages. This allows you to serve pre-built HTML pages, which ensures fast load times and low server load.
b. Implement server-side rendering or static generation for better performance and search engine optimization (SEO).
c. If necessary, use a headless CMS (e.g., Strapi, Contentful) to manage and store your wiki content. This allows for easy content updates without requiring direct manipulation of the codebase.

## Search Functionality

a. Implement a search feature using client-side libraries like Lunr.js or server-side solutions like Elasticsearch to help users find relevant content easily.
b. Consider adding filters or tags to narrow down search results based on categories or topics.

## Hyperlinks and Connections

a. Ensure that all internal links point to the correct pages within your wiki.
b. Provide external links to relevant resources, documentation, or websites when appropriate.

## Security and Performance

a. Use HTTPS to encrypt data transfer between your server and users' browsers.
b. Compress images and use responsive image formats (e.g., WebP) to reduce page load times.
c. Use a content delivery network (CDN) to cache and serve static assets, such as images and stylesheets, to reduce server load and ensure faster load times.
d. Optimize your CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files by minifying, bundling, and compressing them to reduce file sizes and improve performance.

## Responsiveness

a. Design the wiki pages with a mobile-first approach to ensure that they look good on different screen sizes and devices.
b. Use a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) to implement a responsive layout and design.

## File Naming Conventions

a. Use descriptive and meaningful file names that reflect the content of the file. This makes it easier for contributors to understand the purpose of the file and locate relevant content.
b. Use lowercase letters and separate words with hyphens instead of spaces or underscores (e.g., `file-naming-conventions.md`). This improves readability and ensures compatibility across different operating systems and web servers.
c. Include a file extension that indicates the file type (e.g., `.md` for Markdown files, `.js` for JavaScript files, `.css` for CSS files).
d. Organize files into appropriate directories based on their purpose or content. For example, group images in an `images` directory, stylesheets in a `styles` directory, and scripts in a `scripts` directory.
e. When dealing with multiple versions or revisions of a file, include a version number or timestamp in the file name (e.g., `article-v2.md` or `article-2023-05-02.md`). This helps track changes and avoid confusion when collaborating on updates.
f. For the website project, maintain a consistent naming convention across all directories and file types to ensure easy navigation and maintenance.


## Code Standardization with React.js and Strapi

a. Use a consistent code style across your entire React.js project. Implement a linter (e.g., ESLint) and a formatter (e.g., Prettier) to enforce a uniform coding style.
b. Organize your React.js components in a logical and modular manner. Group related components in dedicated directories (e.g., `src/components/navigation` for navigation components).
c. Utilize functional components and hooks when possible to improve performance and reduce complexity.
d. Implement a state management solution (e.g., Redux or Context API) to manage application state efficiently and consistently.
e. Document your components and their props using tools like JSDoc or PropTypes to improve maintainability and collaboration.
f. Use Strapi as your headless CMS to manage and store your wiki content. Leverage Strapi's RESTful or GraphQL API to fetch content from your React.js application.
g. Configure environment variables to store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) and ensure these variables are not exposed in the source code.
h. Write unit tests for your React.js components using testing frameworks and libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
i. When integrating Strapi with React.js, keep the API calls and data manipulation logic separate from the UI components to maintain a clean and modular codebase.
j. Use a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline to automate the testing and deployment process for your React.js and Strapi applications.
